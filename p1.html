    <h1>Pre Amendment English Poor Law Cases</h1>

    <div class="event-details">
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 1690 - 1815</p>
       
        <p>The Poor Laws, was established as a British welfare system in the 16th century. This system underwent a significant change with the <strong style="color: #003366;">Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834</strong>. This reform introduced a rigid distinction between the "deserving" and "undeserving" poor, forcing those in need into punitive workhouses. The stigma attached to seeking aid, along with localized data collection by individual boards, embedded biases into the records of the time. This data shows examples of cases from before the 1834 amendment.</p>
    </div>
    
    

    <div id="map"></div>

    <!-- Information Box (Map Key) -->
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Glossary</h3>
        <p><strong>Whig Government:</strong> Political leaders who identified with the Whig Party - associated with constitutional monarchy and protecting the interests of the emerging middle class. </p>
        <p><strong>Parish:</strong> Small administrative district with its own church.</p>
        <p><strong>Settlement:</strong> Legal concept (from 17th and 18th century) used to determine which parish or locality is responsible for the support of a poor person. When a person became a "settled" resident in a parish, it meant that the parish was responsible for providing them with relief.</p>
    </div>

      <!-- Information Box 2-->
      <div class="info-box2">
        <h3>Further Context</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Whig government</strong> enforced the new Poor Law as a means to adapt to socio-economic shifts caused by the <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong>, while still preserving their own class interests.</p>
        <p> The <strong>1834 Amendment Act</strong> replaced local parish-based assistance with larger poor law unions managed by boards of guardians, overseen by a central authority in London. </p>
        <p> Present day American welfare operates similarly in the sense that programs such as SNAP and Medicaid are <strong>federally funded but state administered</strong>. There is increasing federal input regarding how the aid is distributed.</p>
        <p> Under the 19th century Poor Law, workhouses became the <strong>primary source of aid</strong>. Life in the workhouses was <strong>intentionally cruel</strong> and undesirable, these conditions were meant to discourage people from seeking government aid.</p>
        <p> Many present day American welfare programs, such as TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) have work requirements in place to deter the assistance of long term aid. </p>
